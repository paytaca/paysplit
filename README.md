# Paytaca Paysplit Project (Recent Changes)

- Modified UIs for QR-code Scanner dialog. 'Clear and Re-scan' icon button was added.
- Auto-pause and auto-resume qrcode-stream camera when the bch address is filled and emptied.
- BCH address saving through localStorage so users need not to fill-in their bch address next session.
- Changed backdrop/bacground color for the 'main-function' dialogs to light-reddish-pink.

## Next targets:
  - New layout for generated qr-codes display dialog.
